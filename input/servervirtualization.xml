          The scope of this Module is to define the security functionality of a Server Virtualization product in
          terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This Module is not 
          complete in itself, but rather extends the Protection Profile for Virtualization (Base Virtualization PP).
          This is because Server Virtualization is a specific type of Virtualization System and is expected to
          implement security functionality that is not common to all Virtualization Systems in general. Therefore,
          additional SFRs have been defined in this EP to define security functionality that is unique to this
          particular type of Virtualization System.

     	  <term full="Administrator">Administrators perform management activities on the VS. These management functions 
          do not include administration of software running within Guest VMs, such as the Guest OS. Administrators need
          not be human as in the case of embedded or headless VMs. Administrators are often nothing more than software
          entities that operate within the VM.</term>
	  <term full="Auditor">Auditors are responsible for managing the audit capabilities of the TOE. An Auditor may
          also be an Administrator. It is not a requirement that the TOE be capable of supporting an Auditor role that
          is separate from that of an Administrator.</term>

	      <term full="Domain">A Domain or Information Domain is a policy construct that groups together execution 
          environments and networks by sensitivity of information and access control policy. For example, classification
          levels represent information domains. Within classification levels, there might be other domains representing
          communities of interest or coalitions. In the context of a VS, information domains are generally implemented
          as collections of VMs connected by virtual networks. The VS itself can be considered an Information Domain, 
          as can its Management Subsystem.</term>

	      <term full="Guest VM">A Guest VM is a VM that contains a virtual environment for the execution of an independent
          computing system. Virtual environments execute mission workloads and implement customer-specific client or
          server functionality in Guest VMs, such as a web server or desktop productivity applications.</term>
	      <term full="Helper VM">A Helper VM is a VM that performs services on behalf of one or more Guest VMs, but does
          not qualify as a Service VM—and therefore is not part of the VMM. Helper VMs implement functions or services
          that are particular to the workloads of Guest VMs. For example, a VM that provides a virus scanning service
          for a Guest VM would be considered a Helper VM. For the purposes of this document, Helper VMs are considered 
          a type of Guest VM, and are therefore subject to all the same requirements, unless specifically stated 
          otherwise.</term>

          the Host OS is part of the Platform.</term>
	      <term full="Hypervisor">The Hypervisor is part of the VMM. It is the software executive of the physical platform
          of a VS. A Hypervisor’s primary function is to mediate access to all CPU and memory resources, but it is also
          responsible for either the direct management or the delegation of the management of all other hardware
          devices on the hardware platform.</term>

	      <term full="Management Network">A network, which may have both physical and virtualized components, used to 
          manage and administer a VS. Management networks include networks used by VS Administrators to communicate
          with management components of the VS, and networks used by the VS for communications between VS components. 
          For purposes of this document, networks that connect physical hosts for purposes of VM transfer or coordinate,
          and backend storage networks are considered management networks. </term>
	      <term full="Management Subsystem">Components of the VS that allow VS Administrators to configure and manage the
          VMM, as well as configure Guest VMs. VMM management functions include VM configuration, virtualized network
          configuration, and allocation of physical resources.</term>

          virtualized components, used to connect Guest VMs to each other and potentially to other entities outside of
          the VS. Operational Networks support mission workloads and customer-specific client or server functionality.

		      services necessary to support Guest VMs. Service VMs may implement some portion of Hypervisor functionality, but 
		      also may contain important system functionality that is not necessary for Hypervisor operation. As with any VM,
		      Service VMs necessarily execute without full Hypervisor privileges—only the privileges required to perform its 
		      designed functionality. Examples of Service VMs include device driver VMs that manage access to a physical devices,
		      and name-service VMs that help establish communication paths between VMs.</term>

      <section id="targets" title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
        Server Virtualization, for the purposes of this EP, refers to a virtualization system that implements 
        virtualized hardware components on server-class hardware. It creates a virtualized hardware environment for 
        each instance of an operating system (virtual machines or VMs) permitting these environments to execute
        concurrently while maintaining isolation and the appearance of exclusive control over assigned computing
        resources. Each VM instance supports applications such as file servers, web servers, and mail servers. Server
        virtualization may also support client operating systems in a virtual desktop or thin-client environment.
        Typically, virtualized servers provide services to remote clients from a data center, and are generally not
	directly accessible by non-administrative users.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
	A TOE that claims conformance with this PP Module must also claim conformance to the Protection Profile 
	for Virtualization. And a TOE that claims comformance with the Protection Profile for Virtualization
	must also claim conformance either to this Module or to the PP Module for Client Virtualization.

                            It is unlikely that this table will be identified as “Table 1” in the ST. The ST author is permitted to apply a refinement operation to the table name in order to give it an appropriate identification. The ST author is expected to update this table with an indication as to whether any of the ‘optional’ or ‘selection-based’ functions are included as part of the TOE. The ST author may also omit the ‘Notes’ column as it is provided in this EP as an aid to the ST author in constructing this table.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>

                            The evaluator shall verify for each claimed management function that the Operational Guidance is sufficiently detailed to allow the function to be performed and that the function can be performed by the role(s) that are authorized to do so.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
                            The evaluator shall also verify for each claimed management function that if the TOE claims not to provide a particular role with access to the function, then it is not possible to access the TOE as that role and perform that function.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>

        <section id="sar" title="TOE Security Assurance Requirements">
            The Base Virtualization PP lists the Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) from Part 3 of the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision 4. As an EP of the Base Virtualization PP, this EP does not prescribe any SARs beyond those defined in the base PP. The evaluator shall ensure that the SARs defined in the claimed base PP are assessed against the entire TSF as appropriate.

    <appendix id="appendix-optional" title="Optional Requirements">
        As indicated in Section 2, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the TOE) are contained in the body of this EP. Additionally, there are three other types of requirements specified in Appendix A, Appendix B, and Appendix C. The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be included in the ST, but are not required in order for a TOE to claim conformance to this EP. The second type (in Appendix B) are requirements based on selections in the body of the EP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in that appendix must be included. The third type (in Appendix C) are components that are not required in order to conform to this EP, but will be included in the baseline requirements in future versions of this EP, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note that the ST author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with those in Appendix A, Appendix B, and Appendix C but are not listed (e.g., FMT-type requirements) are also included in the ST.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
        Currently, no optional requirements specific to this product type have been identified.

    <appendix id="appendix-sel-based" title="Selection-Based Requirements">
        As indicated in the introduction to this EP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the TOE or its underlying platform) are contained in the body of the EP. There are additional requirements based on selections in the body of the EP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements below will need to be included.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
        Currently, no selection-based requirements specific to this product type have been identified.
    </appendix>
    <appendix id="appendix-objective" title="Objective Requirements">
        This Annex includes requirements that specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently mandated in the body of this EP as they describe security functionality not yet widely available in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the TOE is still conformant to this EP, and it is expected that they be included as soon as possible.<htm:br></htm:br><htm:br></htm:br>
        Currently, no objective requirements specific to this product type have been identified.</appendix>
    <appendix id="ent" title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment">
        The TOE does not require any additional supplementary information to describe its entropy source(s) beyond the requirements outlined in the ‘Entropy Documentation and Assessment’ section of the Base Virtualization PP. As with other base PP requirements, the only additional requirement is that the entropy documentation also applies to the specific Server Virtualization capabilities of the TOE in addition to the functionality required by the base PP.
