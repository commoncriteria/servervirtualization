     	<!-- 1.1 Overview -->
	<section id="overview" title="Overview">
          The scope of this Module is to define the security functionality of a Server Virtualization product in
          terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This PP-Module is not 
          complete in itself, but rather is intended for use with the following Base-PP:
	      
	      <htm:ul>
		      <htm:li>Protection Profile for Virtualization, Version 1.1.</htm:li>
	      </htm:ul>

	  This Base-PP is valid because Server Virtualization is a specific type of Virtualization System and is expected to
          implement security functionality that is not common to all Virtualization Systems. One additional SFR
          has been defined in this PP-Module to define security functionality that is unique to this
          particular type of Virtualization System.

	<!-- 1.2 Terms -->
      <tech-terms>
        <term full="Administrator">Administrators perform management activities on the VS. These management functions 
          do not include administration of software running within Guest VMs, such as the Guest OS. Administrators need
          not be human as in the case of embedded or headless VMs. Administrators are often nothing more than software
          entities that operate within the VM.</term>
      <term full="Domain">A Domain or Information Domain is a policy construct that groups together execution 
          environments and networks by sensitivity of information and access control policy. For example, classification
          levels represent information domains. Within classification levels, there might be other domains representing
          communities of interest or coalitions. In the context of a VS, information domains are generally implemented
          as collections of VMs connected by virtual networks. The VS itself can be considered an Information Domain, 
          as can its Management Subsystem.</term>
      <term full="Guest Operating System (OS)">An operating system that runs within a Guest VM.</term>
      <term full="Guest VM">A Guest VM is a VM that contains a virtual environment for the execution of an independent
          computing system. Virtual environments execute mission workloads and implement customer-specific client or
          server functionality in Guest VMs, such as a web server or desktop productivity applications.</term>
     <term full="Host Operating System (OS)">An operating system onto which a VS is installed. Relative to the VS, 
          the Host OS is part of the Platform.</term>
      <term full="Hypervisor">The Hypervisor is part of the VMM. It is the software executive of the physical platform
          of a VS. A Hypervisor’s primary function is to mediate access to all CPU and memory resources, but it is also
          responsible for either the direct management or the delegation of the management of all other hardware
          devices on the hardware platform.</term>
      <term full="Hypercall">An API function that allows VM-aware software running within a VM to invoke VMM functionality.</term>
      <term full="Management Subsystem">Components of the VS that allow VS Administrators to configure and manage the
          VMM, as well as configure Guest VMs. VMM management functions include VM configuration, virtualized network
          configuration, and allocation of physical resources.</term>
      <term abbr="OS" full="Operating System"/>
      <term full="Platform">The hardware, firmware, and software environment into which a VS is installed and executes.</term>
      <term full="User">Users operate Guest VMs and are subject to configuration policies applied to the VS by Administrators.
		      Users need not be human as in the case of embedded or headless VMs, users are often nothing more than software
		      entities that operate within the VM.</term>
      <term full="Virtual Machine" abbr="VM">A Virtual Machine is a virtualized hardware environment in which an operating system
		      may execute.</term>
      <term full="Virtual Machine Manager" abbr="VMM">A VMM is a collection of software components responsible for enabling VMs to
		      function as expected by the software executing within them. Generally, the VMM consists of a Hypervisor, Service 
		      VMs, and other components of the VS, such as virtual devices, binary translation systems, and physical device
		      drivers. It manages concurrent execution of all VMs and virtualizes platform resources as needed.</term>
      <term full="Virtualization System" abbr="VS">A software product that enables multiple independent computing systems to 
		      execute on the same physical hardware platform without interference from one other. For the purposes of this 
		      document, the VS consists of a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), Virtual Machine abstractions, a management subsystem,

	<!-- 1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation -->
      <section id="targets" title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
        Server Virtualization, for the purposes of this Module, refers to a virtualization system that implements 
        virtualized hardware components on server-class hardware. It creates a virtualized hardware environment for 
        each instance of an operating system (virtual machines or VMs) permitting these environments to execute
        concurrently while maintaining isolation and the appearance of exclusive control over assigned computing
        resources. Each VM instance supports applications such as file servers, web servers, and mail servers. Server
        virtualization may also support client operating systems in a virtual desktop or thin-client environment.
        Typically, virtualized servers provide services to remote clients from a data center, and are generally not
	directly accessible by non-administrative users.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
	A TOE that claims conformance with this PP Module must also claim conformance to the Protection Profile 
	for Virtualization. And a TOE that claims comformance with the Protection Profile for Virtualization
	must also claim conformance either to this Module or to the PP Module for Client Virtualization.

				column as it is provided in this EP as an aid to the ST author in constructing this table.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                            This SFR addresses the roles of the CC Part 2 SFRs FMT_MOF.1, FMT_SMF.1, and FMT_SMR.2.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                            Administration is considered “local” if the Administrator is physically present at the machine on which the VS
				is installed.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                            Administration is considered “remote” if communications between the Administrator and the Management Subsystem
				travel on a network.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                            There is no requirement to authenticate Users of the Virtualization System. Users that have access to VMs but
				not to the Management Subsystem need not authenticate to the Virtualization System in order to use Guest
				VMs. Requirements for authentication of VM users is determined by the policies of the domains running
				within the Guest VMs.<htm:br/><htm:br/>

                            		The evaluator shall examine the TSS and Operational Guidance to ensure that it describes which 
					security management functions require Administrator privilege and the actions associated with each 
					management function. The evaluator shall verify that for each management function and role
					specified in Table 1, the defined role is able to perform all mandatory functions as well as all 
					optional or selection-based functions claimed in the ST.<htm:br/><htm:br/>

				<Guidance>
	                            The evaluator shall examine the Operational Guidance to ensure that it describes how the Administrator
					or User are able to perform each management function that the ST claims the TOE supports.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
                            		The evaluator shall verify for each claimed management function that the Operational Guidance is 
					sufficiently detailed to allow the function to be performed and that the function can be performed
					by the role(s) that are authorized to do so.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
				</Guidance>
				<Tests>
	                            The evaluator shall also verify for each claimed management function that if the TOE claims not to provide a
					particular role with access to the function, then it is not possible to access the TOE as that
					role and perform that function.<htm:br/><htm:br/>
